### Hi there, I'm Curtis Taylor Peterson! ðŸ‘‹

I am a computational particle physicist that specializes in lattice field theory. I am interested primarily in
software development for high-performance computing and the application of renormalization group techniques
to strongly-coupled field theories; however, I love to explore topics ranging from machine 
learning to differential geometry and just about anything in-between.
